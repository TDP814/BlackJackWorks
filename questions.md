3.How are classes in Java used to create a complicated program? The classes in Java interact with one another through extensions that break up a compilcated program into smaller easier to understand pieces of code.
4.What is the difference between a private and public variable? Method?

A private method will only run in the file it is called as a public can be called in multiple files.
